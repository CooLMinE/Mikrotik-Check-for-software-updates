# Mikrotik script for checking for new software updates 

With the use of this script and MikroTik's scheduler you can setup your device to send you an email when a new MikroTik **software** update becomes available.

This method has been tested in the last few versions of **RouterOS** (currently 6.38). For older versions you might need to alter the script functions a bit to get everything working correctly.
